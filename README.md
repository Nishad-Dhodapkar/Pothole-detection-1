# Real-Time-Pothole-Detection-Using-YOLO

The potholes are a big problem for the roads safety and integrity of the infrastructure, hence, there is a call for good detection and fixing techniques. In this study, we present a new method of pothole detection using computer vision techniques. Applying achievements in machine learning and image processing, the methodology will be aimed at the precise identification of potholes from road images. We collected a wide range of pothole images dataset, labeled with bounding boxes, for the training process. Our mission is to assess the efficiency of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm in identifying potholes in real time. We empirically validate and validate the robustness and efficiency of our approach in the real-world conditions through extensive experimentation on different environment datasets and road settings. The outcome of our research extends beyond pothole detection and has potential applications that include better road safety, low maintenance costs and management of transportation infrastructure.
